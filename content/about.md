# About

Welcome to my personal blog.

## How the website works

The blogs are generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with [hermit-v2](https://github.com/1bl4z3r/hermit-V2?tab=readme-ov-file) and hosted on GitHub page. 

As for blog editting, I come up with a simple workflow and I think it's worth sharing. This workflow keeps everything in-browser and relies on no third-party platform like Netlify-CMS or JekyllPad

- I write these blogs in the **[GitHub's native web-based editor](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor)**. You can enter this editor by changing the url of a github repo from `github.com/...` to `github.dev/...`. By some black magic, this editor lets you use VSCode in your browser. Extension, profile, key-binding, everything that makes VSCode a good blog editor.

- Real-time, side-by-side preview is powered by the amazing VSCode extension **[Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)**.

For programmers like myself who use VSCode daily, this workflow has pretty much no learning curve, and there is barely any environment setup to do. Plus, you get the benifit to use your favorite color scheme and extensions. For me, I'm using GitHub Dark High Contrast and the Vim key binding.
