Welcome to my personal blog. Here is a random screenshot from a random anime.

## How the website works

The blogs are generated by Jekyll and hosted on GitHub page. 

To make life easier without relying on WordPress or some headless CMS, I write these blogs in [GitHub's native web-based editor](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor) (by changing the url of github blog repo from `github.com/...` to `github.dev/...`). Real-time, side-by-side preview is powered by the amazing VSCode extension [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)
