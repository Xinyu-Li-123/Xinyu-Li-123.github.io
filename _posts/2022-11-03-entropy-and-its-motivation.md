Hello $$x = 2$$

$$y=3$$

Information is untangible, but we can quantify it in a way that matches our intuition. 

An amount of information.

The number is meaningful only when it's in relation to other numbers. For example, "film A contains 10000 unit of information" means nothing unless we can also say "film B contains 20000 unit of information, thus it's more informative than film A".
